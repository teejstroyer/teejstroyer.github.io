As an **Aspiring** ***Jack of All Trades*** and somewhat of a *programmers masochist*, I tend to challenge myself more than I can handle.
Many years after college I've found that my curiosity continues to grow. Much to my wifes dismay, I do a lot of one off experiments and simulations, a weekend gone, but the knowledge of XYZ is still there. So if im going to do a one off experiment, I might as well document my findings.

I am a DotNet developer by day (C#, SQL Server, React/Angular, etc...), by night, I experiment with flutter/dart, rust, c#, c++, etc, and oh yes of course, my vim/neovim config way too much.

I hate frameworks, but I love the speed of development they give you. I love low level programming, but I also hate how much time you waste getting set up.

I love vim/neovim, mobile development, peer to peer, **FREE** services (A free peer to peer platform would be amazing), game development, simulations, and web development

I think that WebAssembly has the potential to be the future of desktop/mobile/web. A truly write once run anywhere platform.

Rambling aside, this "blog" site is designed to force me to be more accountable with my side projects, as I mentioned before, I am a *programmers masochist*, and I want to make sure that I work/learn outside of work.

Lastly, I am the type of person to add Log("HERE") instead of debugging.
